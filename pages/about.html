                    <h2>Types of Succulents</h2>
                    <p>Succulents as a whole have very similar care needs. But sometimes particular plants will need slightly different amounts of water or sunlight than others.</p>
                    <p>If you are looking for indoor succulents, start with <strong>Haworthia</strong>. If you need snow loving outdoor succulents start with <strong>Sempervivum</strong>.</p>
                    <p>And if you are looking for heat loving succulents, take a look at <strong>Opuntia</strong> or <strong>Agave</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Succulents that have been just moved from a shady location to direct sunlight are likely to get a sunburn.</p>
                    <p>The sunburn on a succulent plant shows the worst damage at the top and side facing the sun. Ridges are more likely to burn than valleys along the plant stem.</p>
                    <h3>Treatment</h3>
                    <p>If you catch a sunburned succulent at the whitish discoloring stage, you can undo the damage by getting it some shade protection.</p>

                    <p>Soils are essential for life on earth and critical in many environmental challenges facing the earth.</p>
                    <p>The most important consideration in making potting soil for succulents is that it will drain well. The soil must be porous so that water penetrates easily and drains away quickly.</p>
                    <p>An example of a good soil mix for succulents is two parts by volume of potting soil: <strong>1 part perlite</strong> and <strong>1 part small-size gravel</strong>, e.g., pumice, turface, or crushed granite.</p>

                    <h2 id="water">How to water</h2>
                    <p>Rather than giving your succulents sips of water here and there, give them a good soaking, to the point the water runs out the drainage holes at the bottom of the pot.</p>
                    <p>Be sure to empty the water that runs into the saucer beneath the plant pot. Then let the soil dry out completely before watering again.</p>

                    <p>Potted succulents often require less watering and fertilizer than other houseplants, but they require nutrients from the soil, so they need periodic feeding.</p>
                    <p>Dissolve a low-balanced soluble fertilizer, such as an <strong>8-8-8</strong> or <strong>10-10-10 </strong>formula, in <strong>1 gallon (3.8 l)</strong> of water. Use half the amount recommended on the package for most succulents.</p>
